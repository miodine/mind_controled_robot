# Final Project - M2SAAS

## General information

* Topic: *Development of control routines for BCI-based control of a mobile platform.*

* Authors: *P. Rozenblut* & *E. Robakowska*
 
## About the workspace 

This is the master repository for all the project work that we will be doing. I've divided it into three sections: 

1. [ros_workspace](ros_workspace) for all the work done in ROS
2. [docs](docs) for all the documentation of the project CODE; this one is rather optional
3. [data_analysis](data_analysis) for the work output of data analysis of the dataset
4. [other](other) for all the other things.

## Our technological stack

Stuff that I will be using:

0. VMWare-17-Workstation Player [[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)]
1. Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop [[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.5/l)] [[DOWNLOAD TORRENT](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent)]
2. ROS Noetic [[HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)]

## Workflow Tools

Same as always:

1. ClickUp for organisation of tasks at hand
2. Overleaf for producing the thesis-like paper for the supervisor 
3. Collab for optional data analysis -- NOT RECOMMENDED because we will 
be handling large files.


## Notes on development

1. Both C++ and Python code should be commented 
    * in a minimal way 
    * using markdown styling
